**Abstract:**
Biomaterials such as wood flour are often added to plastics to form Wood-plastic composites (WPCs) to enhance the mechanical properties of the plastic resin while producing a renewable material. The structural performance of WPCs are highly influenced by both the distribution and orientation of the fibers within the composite. Additionally, the fiberâ€™s distribution and orientation is highly influenced by rheology during the manufacturing process. Accurate measurement of fiber distribution and orientation in WPCs is important to both predicting the mechanical properties of the material and for studying how manufacturing parameters impact the fiber distribution and orientation.

While fiber density and orientation can be inferred from the macroscale material properties, the only way to directly measure the fibers is through imaging. Image processing of microscopy images of WPCs is not straightforward as distinguishing between the polymer matrix and fiber in the image can be difficult.  This is compounded by noise introduced at various scales in the image. During manufacturing, fiber agglomerations are formed from incomplete mixing of the fibers and resin; microtoming introduces noise during sample preparation; and the cellophane tape used to secure the specimen creates artifacts in the images.

Our group aims to develop a program capable of analyzing the fiber distribution, density, and orientation in these WPCs.
